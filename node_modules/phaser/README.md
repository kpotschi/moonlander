Phaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework that offers WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers and has been actively developed for over 10 years.

Games can be built for the web, or as YouTube Playables, Discord Activities, Twitch Overlays or compiled to iOS, Android, Steam and native apps using 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development. Phaser supports over 40 different front-end frameworks including React and Vue.

Phaser is commercially developed and maintained by **Phaser Studio Inc** along with our fantastic open source community. As a result of rapid support, and a developer friendly API, Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/collections/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.

## v4 Release Candidate 4

You are looking at Release Candidate 4 of Phaser v4. There are large internal differences between Phaser v3 and v4, although the public API has remained mostly, but not entirely, the same.

Please only use this release if you wish to help beta test Phaser v4.

Phaser v4 contains our brand-new and highly efficient WebGL renderer. The entire renderer from v3 has been replaced.

We also took this opportunity to make other Quality-of-Life updates internally, which you can find detailed in [this change log](changelog/4.0/CHANGELOG-v4.0.0.md).

## Installing Phaser 4 Beta from NPM

Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phaser):

```bash
npm install phaser@beta
```

## Phaser TypeScript Definitions

Full TypeScript definitions can be found inside the [types folder](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/tree/master/types). They are also referenced in the `types` entry in `package.json`, meaning modern editors such as VSCode will detect them automatically.

Depending on your project, you may need to add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
"lib": ["es6", "dom", "dom.iterable", "scripthost"],
"typeRoots": ["./node_modules/phaser/types"],
"types": ["Phaser"]
```

## Have fun!

Grab the source and join the fun!

Phaser wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic support of the community. Thank you to everyone who supports our work, who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phaser's role in that.

Happy coding everyone!

Cheers,

[Rich](mailto:rich@phaser.io) and the whole team at Phaser Studio
